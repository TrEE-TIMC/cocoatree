================
Load a tree file
================

This is a small example expliciting how to load a tree file in :mod:`cocoatree`
using :func:`cocoatree.io.load_tree_ete3` function.

Let's start by creating a simplified tree:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 15-19

.. code-block:: Python

    simple_tree = "(A:1,(B:1,(C:1,D:1):0.5):0.5);"
    t = load_tree_ete3(simple_tree)
    print(t)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none


       /-A
    --|
      |   /-B
       \-|
         |   /-C
          \-|
             \-D




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 20-22

Here, we have a tree with distances and leaf names. The distances are
specified after the ``:`` character and the leaf names are A, B, C, and D.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-26

:func:`cocoatree.io.load_tree_ete3` also accepts trees with more information
such as branch support values encoded as follow:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-29

.. code-block:: Python

    bootstrap_tree = "(A:1,(B:1,(C:1,D:1)95:0.5)98:0.5);"
    t_boot = load_tree_ete3(bootstrap_tree)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 30-32

The branch support values are placed following their corresponding closing
bracket.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-40

.. warning::
      Only one type of branch support value is accepted (i.e. a file with
      bootstrap and jack-knife branch support values will not be accepted).

      Branch support values should not be between square brackets as those
      are not accepted.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 42-47
