# Custom SCA

# WIP, breaking changes will happen & git history will be rewritten to ensure a clean commit tree

To install for development purposes, use::

    python setup.py develop


All changes in the python module will be repercuted on the installed version
(in practice the installed version is a symlink towards the package in
development).
