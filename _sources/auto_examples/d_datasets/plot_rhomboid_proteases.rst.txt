Rhomboid proteases
====================

This example shows how the Rhomboid dataset is organized and how you can use it
to test cocoatree's features.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 11-12

Load the dataset

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-20

.. code-block:: Python

    import numpy as np
    from cocoatree.datasets import load_rhomboid_proteases
    import cocoatree.msa as c_msa
    import cocoatree.statistics.position as c_pos

    dataset = load_rhomboid_proteases()
    print(dataset.keys())

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-33

`dataset` is a dictionary with 6 elements:
  - `sequence_ids`: a list of the sequence identifiers for the MSA
  - `alignment`: the aligned sequences
  - `sector_positions`: a Numpy NpzFile of the sectors' positions as found in
the Mihaljević and Urban study
  - `metadata`: a Pandas dataframe containing metadata associated with the
alignment, such as taxonomic information.
  - `pdb_sequence`: a tuple of the 2NRF pdb sequence from E. coli
  - `pdb_positions`: a list of the named positions found in the PDB

Access the sequence data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-40

.. code-block:: Python

    loaded_seqs = dataset["alignment"]
    loaded_seqs_id = dataset["sequence_ids"]
    n_loaded_pos, n_loaded_seqs = len(loaded_seqs[0]), len(loaded_seqs)

    print(f"The loaded MSA has {n_loaded_seqs} sequences and {n_loaded_pos} \
          positions.")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    The loaded MSA has 2767 sequences and 135       positions.

Example of sequence filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-53

.. code-block:: Python

        loaded_seqs, loaded_seqs_id, gap_threshold=0.4, seq_threshold=0.2)

    print(f"After filtering, we have {n_pos} remaining positions.")
    print(f"After filtering, we have {len(sequences)} remaining sequences.")

    seq_weights, m_eff = c_pos.compute_seq_weights(sequences)
    print('Number of effective sequences %d' %
          np.round(m_eff))

Access sector information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    for sect in sectors:

.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    There are 3 sectors
    sector_1 is composed of: 14 positions.
    sector_2 is composed of: 10 positions.
