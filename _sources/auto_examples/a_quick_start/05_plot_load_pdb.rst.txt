=========================
Load a PDB structure file
=========================

This small example shows how to use :func:`cocoatree.io.load_pdb` to import
your own PDB structure file.

This function allows you to extract the amino acid sequence associated with the
PDB file, as well as the residue numbering, which is necessary to specify the
residues to highlight in PyMOL for example.

We will use the PDB structure of rat trypsin as an example. The file can be
downloaded at: https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3TGI. It is also the structure
that is included in :func:`cocoatree.datasets.load_S1A_serine_proteases`.

.. code-block:: Python

    pdb_seq, pdb_pos = load_pdb('data/3TGI.pdb', pdb_id='3TGI', chain='E')


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-37

The ``pdb_id`` argument is the ID that will be used for the structure, in
this case, we choose `3TGI`, but it could be `TRYPSIN` or any name that the
user finds fitting.

In order to understand the function's ``chain`` argument, you need to open
the PDB in an editor to check the information included within your file:

As you can see, there are actually two molecules in the PDB:
  - rat trypsin
  - bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor

It is necessary to specify which molecule you wish to load by using the
``chain`` argument. In this case, it is ``chain='E'`` for trypsin, and
``chain='I'`` for the trypsin inhibitor.

For a comparison, here are the first lines of E. coli dihydrofolate
reductase's PDB file (which is the one included in cocoatree's
:func:`cocoatree.datasets.load_DHFR`):

In this case, there is only one molecule, which is accessed by specifying
``chain='A'``.

You can now access the pdb sequence and the residue numbering:
